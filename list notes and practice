#notes
#instead of writing a ton of variables for the same thing we can use arrays/lists
grades = [100,90,92,86,89,90]

print(grades)

#print line by line everything in the grades list
for x in grades:
  print(x)

#arrays/lists can have different data types and mixed data types
items=["h","i","j","k"]  
list=['a','b','c',1,2,3]
